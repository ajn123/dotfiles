Place of beauty
state of crime
this whole place
is on borrowed time
fenced plots the dare still roam 
while humans are trapped in expensive homes
ancient land with a new culture that won't see the circling vulture
the streets are clean the rivers poisoned the waters owned 
the land is stolen the birth of noise the death of silence
kind smiles and hot violence warm greetings for the white factions
brown faces get cruel actions 
land of the free where the people are herded 
the trails are clean while the buffalo are murdered
a psycho clown is the elected king 
the flowers still bloom and the birds still sing
wilderness lives but badly treated natures hurt and not defeated
this land of beauty this state of crime it's killing nature but theres
still time while the prairies grow the fawful know the losses are big
but this is war 
and theres still some life worth fighting for
