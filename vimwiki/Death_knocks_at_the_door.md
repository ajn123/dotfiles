Death knocks at our door
no one is looking at all the blood on the floor
leaders roll in the mud
beavers fear the flood
old tribes still get mean vibes
facists destroy everyone's lives
Essential questions are never mentioned
will the oceans still be in Motion 
Will the land still play on with the band
will the sky still be able to fly
our death culture fails to see the circling vulture

Death knocks at our door
Our atmosphere is telling us to get the hell out of here 
black tar reaches bfar 
consumption rules us all
greed is our only creed
Patriarchy only fuels the monarchy
Electronic hallucinations trap all our vibrations

Death knocks at the our door 
what are we all fighting for?
to resist radical evil gives us meaning
you don't have to fight your feelings 
emotion is one of our potions
mother nature faces erasure
will we live to see more glaciers

Death knocks at our door
to see what we have in store
we say we know you will win
for we are all full of sin
but today we keep death at bay
we say not today only love remains.
