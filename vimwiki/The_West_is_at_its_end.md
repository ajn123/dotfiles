The west is at its end
but we can still be best friends
To try to escape is a mistake
you can only fight when you are awake
capitalism can only be confronted by activism

You spent all this time talking about a wall
you failed to see our great big fall

The west has nothing left but theft
we offer no depth even at our best
our only option is death
when you are offered the pill 
you are on your way to the treadmill

When you get in a pinch
remember solving climate change is not a sinch
We should not let up, even one inch
We grow a little taller everytime we don't falter


pesticides are responsible for wide genocides
Genetic modification creates nuclear annihilation
oil only makes the earth boil
the birth of war makes few royal while others toil
why do so many leaders seem made of tin foil


Our children grow up in hell 
Why did you fail to raise the bell

The future is clear 
we have nothing left to fear
we have one chance to get our act in gear
we have one last chance to hold everything dear.
