# Legal Notes 


Keep in mind the credo: If no one talks, everyone walks. Regardless of what you are told by an 
investigating officer, you have nothing to gain by talking to the police ... and everything to lose.

Being detained


resisting arrest is another crime 

Ask if you are being detained and are free to go.

Ask if your under arrest, they can't move you until you're under arrest 
- Have a police liason to talk to them

There are state crimes and federal crimes: 
- Class A: $4,000 fine and jail time
- Class B: 6 months and 2,0000$ fine
- Class C: 500$ no jail time
- Limitation period of two years


Felonies: up to $10,000 fine and 2-99 years jail time

In Texas, state jail felonies are punishable by 180 days to two years in state jail and a fine of up to $10,000. 
If lawmakers identify a crime as a felony but fail to designate it as a particular 
kind of felony or set a specific sentence, then the felony is a state jail felony.
